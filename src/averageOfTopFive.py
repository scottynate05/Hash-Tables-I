# Given a list of different students' scores, write a function that returns the average of each student's top five scores. You should return the averages in ascending order of the students' id numbers.

# Each entry (scores[i]) has the student's id number (scores[i][0]) and the student's score (scores[i][1]). The averages should be calculated using integer division.

# Example 1:

# Input: [[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]
# Output: [[1,87],[2,88]]
# Explanation:
# The average student `1` is `87`.
# The average of student `2` is `88.6`, but with integer division is `88`.
